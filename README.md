# Experiment 1
## Program 1: Hello World
Aim:
To print "Hello World" using C++.

Software:
Visual Studio Code

Theory:
The "Hello World" program is a beginner's first step in learning a new programming language. It shows how to use basic syntax, including libraries, the main() function, and printing to the console. The main() function is where the program starts running. The std namespace is used to simplify syntax.

Output:

Conclusion:
We learned how to display text in C++ and successfully printed "Hello World".

Program 2: User Input and Output
Aim:
To get input from the user and display it.

Software:
Visual Studio Code

Theory:
To get user input, we use cin with the >> operator. This lets the user enter data like numbers or text. The program then shows this input using cout.

Output:

Conclusion:
We learned how to take user input and show it in C++.

Program 3: Basic Calculator
Aim:
To create a simple calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Software:
Visual Studio Code

Theory:
This program does basic math operations. It asks the user for two numbers and performs the chosen arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division), then shows the results.

Output:

Conclusion:
We learned to perform basic calculations in C++ and created a simple calculator to display the results.
